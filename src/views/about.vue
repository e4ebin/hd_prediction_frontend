                A Random Forest Algorithm is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is extremely popular and is used for 
                Classification and Regression problems in Machine Learning.
                We know that a forest comprises numerous trees, and the more trees more it will be robust.
                Similarly, the greater the number of trees in a Random Forest Algorithm, 
                the higher its accuracy and problem-solving ability. 
                Random Forest is a classifier that contains several decision trees on various subsets of the given dataset and takes the average to improve the predictive accuracy of that dataset.
                It is based on the concept of ensemble learning which is a process of combining multiple classifiers to solve a complex problem and improve the performance of the model

                Random Forest is popular, and for good reason! It offers a variety of advantages, 
                from accuracy and efficiency to relative ease of use.The most convenient benefit of using random forest is its default ability to correct for decision trees habit of overfitting to their training set.
                Using the bagging method and random feature selection when executing this algorithm almost completely resolves 
                the problem of overfitting which is great because overfitting leads to inaccurate outcomes. 
                Plus, even if some data is missing, Random Forest usually maintains its accuracy.
                Random forest is much more efficient than a single decision tree while performing analysis on a large database. On the other hand, 
                Random Forest is less efficient than a neural network. A neural network, sometimes just called neural net, 
                is a series of algorithms that reveal the underlying relationship within a dataset by mimicking the way that a human brain thinks.
